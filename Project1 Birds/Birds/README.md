Greetings. 

1. This Bird projects implements all 4 aspects of OOP design. (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction)
2. We have Bird interface that includes basic variables and methods that all bird types implement.
3. Then we have a Conservatory class that contains clusters of aviaries.
4. Aviaries have the option to accept and reject a Birds, since there are rules specifying the quantity and type of birds that can coexisit.
5. BirdTypes BirdFood etc. are stored as Enums.
6. No abstraction class was created, since it was not necessary.
